# :jigsaw: iVISPAR
The Interactive Visual-Spatial Reasoning (iVISPAR) benchmark assesses the visual-spatial reasoning abilities of humans and artificial agents. It features a fully customizable sliding tile puzzle simulator using 3D geoms and a natural language API, allowing large vision-language models (LVLMs) to interact with the scene. The benchmark supports evaluation through both vision modality and text-based representations of geoms and their coordinates. The sliding geom puzzle challenges agents to demonstrate visual-spatial scene understanding and effective spatial planning capabilities.

## :joystick: Features
### Benchmarking
- Multi-modal evaluation of visual-spatial reasoning in large vision-language models (LVLMs).
- Includes an LVLM API for integrating models as agents in interactive puzzle-solving tasks.
- Highly customizable with automated tools for testing and evaluation.
### Simulation
- A WebApp with a graphical user interface (GUI) designed for human baseline participants.
- Fully operational out of the box, with no installation or dependency requirements.
- Flexible deployment: run locally or host online on a server setup.
### Puzzle Problem Datasets
- Generate custom datasets of interactive Sliding Geom Puzzles.
- Each puzzle configuration features an animated minimal move sequence (computed using A*) to illustrate its complexity.
- Pre-generated test datasets of puzzle configurations are available for immediate use.

## :mount_fuji: Overview

The repository is organized into four main directories:

1. **Source**: Includes all source code for:
    1. [Configuration](/Source/Configuration): Generating puzzle configuration datasets.
    2. [Experiment](/Source/Experiment): Running experiments.
    3. [Evaluation](/Source/Evaluation): Evaluating experiments.
    4. [iVISPAR](/Source/iVISPAR): The Unity project for the WebApp in iVISPAR
2. **Data**: Contains all data used or generated by the source code, including
     1. [Configuration datasets](/Data/Configs/),
     2. [Experiment data](/Data/Experiments/),
     3. [Task instructions](Data/Instructions/),
     4. [API keys](/Data/API-keys/),
     5. [Experiment results](/Data/Resulsts/).
3. **iVISPAR**: Holds the compiled WebApp.
4. **Resources**: Contains metadata files for the repository.

## :rocket: Quick Start

You can find an example of how to run the code in [Source/main.py](Source/main.py). It will open the iVISPAR WebApp on your browser and copy the client ID into the Python console. We've prepared a comprehensive **Getting Started Guide** with instructions to help you get started with the iVISPAR benchmark.

1. [How to run experiments](Resources/HowTo/how_to_run_experiments.md)
2. [How to generate configurations (optional)](Resources/HowTo/how_to_generate_configurations.md)
3. [How to evaluate the results](Resources/HowTo/how_to_evaluate_results.md)

## :package: Setup

### Clone

You can clone our repository with 

```
# Clone the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/SharkyBamboozle/iVISPAR.git

# Set the environment variable (for Unix/Linux/MacOS)
$ export iVISPAR_Root=$(pwd)/iVISPAR

# For Windows users (PowerShell equivalent)
$ $env:iVISPAR_Root = (Get-Location).Path + "\iVISPAR"
```

### Conda

The experiment uses Python 3. You can find the list of Python dependencies in [Resources/environment.yml](Resources/environment.yml). We recommend downloading Anaconda and making a conda environment with

```
$ conda env create -f Resources/environment.yml
```

### Unity

The project comes with the compiled [iVISPAR](iVISPAR) WebApp, which should work out of the box on any common OS with a browser installed. The WebApp is written in C# with Unity and its code source code is available under [Source/iVISPAR](Source/iVISPAR). It is unnecessary to code C# or compile the Unity project to run experiments with iVISPAR.
